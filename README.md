# sousou-no-frieren
This is my personal project aiming at creating an anime website. It consists of four sections: Landing page, Characters page, Galleries page, and a VA (Voice Actor) page. The landing page showcases a background video of the anime and a navbar on top. The characters page is arranged by images of the anime characters and when clicked, they will play a sample voice of the characters. The galleries page contains five images next to each other and there will be an animation when hovered.
